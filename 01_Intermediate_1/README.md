## 🎯 Project Goals
The primary objective of this project was to transform a fragmented set of business data into a streamlined, automated reporting system. 

Key goals included:
1. **Data Integrity:** Cleaning and auditing raw HR and Sales exports to ensure accuracy.
2. **Efficiency:** Replacing manual calculations with dynamic formulas and named ranges.
3. **Visibility:** Creating an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends across Australian states (VIC, NSW, WA).

## 🛠️ Technical Process: "What I Did"

### 1. Advanced Data Modeling & Consolidation
* **3D Formulas:** Consolidated expenses across multiple department worksheets (HR, IT, Sales) into a master summary sheet using 3D references.
* **Workbook Linking:** Established external links between the `Staff` database and `Payroll` records to ensure real-time updates across files.
* **Named Ranges:** Created scope-specific Named Ranges to simplify complex formulas, making the workbook easier for other team members to audit and maintain.

### 2. Complex Logical Calculations
* **Conditional Math:** Implemented `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `AVERAGEIFS` to extract specific KPIs, such as "Total Sales for Women in the VIC region" or "Average order value for Home Office clients."
* **Date & Text Manipulation:** Used `LEFT`, `MID`, `FIND`, and `DATEDIF` to clean employee IDs and calculate "Years of Service" from raw hire dates.

### 3. Data Visualization & Reporting
* **Interactive Dashboards:** Developed a sales cockpit using **PivotTables** and **Slicers**, allowing users to filter the entire report by Account Manager, Year, or Region.
* **Trend Analysis:** Integrated **Sparklines** and **Chart Trendlines** to provide a visual representation of sales velocity and seasonal peaks.
* **Advanced Formatting:** Applied conditional formatting to highlight "High Priority" missing data and top-performing sales tiers.

* **Customer Segment:** The "Corporate" and "Home Office" segments showed the highest growth potential in Q3 and Q4.
* **Staffing:** Optimized the HR database to track pension contributions (9%) and upcoming review dates automatically.
