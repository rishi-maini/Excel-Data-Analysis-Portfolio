## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
This project simulates a real-world business scenario where I consolidated messy data from multiple departments (HR, IT, Sales) into a single automated reporting system.

The challenge was to:

* Clean and validate data with errors and inconsistencies
* Link information across multiple worksheets and workbooks
* Build dynamic formulas that update automatically
* Create an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Applied

### 1. Data Consolidation & Workbook Management
* Used 3D formulas to aggregate expenses across department sheets (HR, IT, Sales) into a master summary
* Created external workbook links between Staff and Payroll files so updates in one file automatically reflect in the other
* Built Named Ranges (both workbook and worksheet-level scope) to make formulas more readable and maintainable

### 2. Advanced Formula Logic
* Applied SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and AVERAGEIFS to extract specific metrics like "total sales by region" or "average order value by customer segment"
* Used text functions (LEFT, MID, FIND) to clean up employee IDs and standardize formatting
* Calculated DATEDIF to determine years of service from hire dates

### 3. Dashboard & Reporting
* Built an interactive sales dashboard using PivotTables with Slicers, allowing users to filter by Account Manager, Year, or Region
* Added Sparklines and chart trendlines to visualize sales patterns over time
* Applied conditional formatting to flag missing data and highlight top performers

## 📈 Key Findings from the Analysis
While working through this dataset, I identified several notable patterns:

* NSW region generated over 50% of total revenue, significantly outperforming VIC and WA
* Corporate and Home Office segments showed the strongest growth in Q3-Q4
* The HR system now automatically tracks 9% pension contributions and flags upcoming performance review dates
